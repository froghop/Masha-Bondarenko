## About
Hello! I'm currently a second year Electrical Engineering & Computer Science student at UC Berkeley, and I'm hoping to minor in bioengineering. My biggest motivator is making an inpact on human health, and I want to do so through engineering. 

My recent experience has given me skills in the research process, software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Feel free to explore some of my work and reach out to me.
