## About
Hello! I'm currently a third year Electrical Engineering & Computer Science student at UC Berkeley with interests in bioengineering. Work I love doing involves the intersection of engineering and medicine. 

I currently work at UCSF in the Big Data in Radiology (BDRAD) lab where I'm involved in various projects and collaborations pertaining to the lungs. 

My recent experience has given me skills in the research process, software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Feel free to explore some of my work and reach out to me.
